            <h2 class="db_header">Gameplay</h2>
            <div class="gameplay">
                <p>At the beginning of a match, the player is placed on one of two teams, either Jackal or CDA, and must complete various objectives in order to win the round whilst fighting both the opposing team and the clock. The player can choose up to three mercenaries, or "mercs", to play as during the round and can switch between them freely between lives. Teamwork and communication are strongly encouraged during the game, hinted at by the ability to revive 'downed' players, as well as the fact that being the "lone wolf" often leads to a short life.</p>
                <p>The gameplay is based on Splash Damage's previous titles Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars and Brink, such as similar classes, gameplay objectives, and certain classes having access to abilities like placing ammunition packs, healing stations, or sentry guns. The main goal of the attacking team either begins by repairing and escorting an Extraction Vehicle, abbreviated to 'EV' in-game, to a predetermined location, or to plant a C4 Charge on a certain target. The objectives after that point are more varied from map to map; for example, on the maps Trainyard, Bridge, and Dome the attackers' goal is now to steal data cores/drug samples from the defending team and deliver them to a helicopter or other area, while on the rest of the maps, the objectives are only to destroy various targets.</p> 
                <p>Available on each map are 'side objectives'; objectives that are not mandatory to complete, but assist the attacking team in completing their ultimate goal. Attackers are encouraged to take advantage of these side objectives before the defending team is able to seize them.</p> 
                <p>There are two playable game modes: Objective and Stopwatch. Execution was formerly the third game mode until it was removed by Splash Damage.</p>
                <p>In Objective mode, the aim is for the attacking team to complete all of the maps objectives before the time runs out. If they are unable to do so, the defending team wins. In Stopwatch mode, the mode is similar to Objective but there are actually two games played, one in which the player is attacking, and the other in which the player is defending. The team that completes the objectives faster wins the game. It is possible for games to end in a draw, and overtime is also implemented where appropriate.</p> 
                <p>Objective and Stopwatch modes have 8 maps available, including Chapel, Underground, Bridge, Terminal, Dome, Dockyard, Castle and Trainyard. After a game is complete, there is a voting system where the players in the lobby can vote on one out of 3 maps (in rotation), and the map with the most votes gets selected.</p>

            <h2 class="db_header">Plot</h2>
            <div class="gameplay">
                <p>In 2020, an atomic explosion occurred in London caused an epidemic contamination of toxic gas spreading throughout the streets, resulting in an evacuation plan. This event was known as the "Dirty Bomb" incident. In response to the hazardous disasters, a new government system called the Central Disaster Authority (CDA) hired mercenaries to fix and coverup the radiation incident. Simultaneously, a criminal syndicate called the Jackal hired their own group of mercenaries to steal the CDA technology that were used to maintain the contaminated air. A stand-off between two factions battle on while the toxic gas continues to spread until there is nothing left standing in its way.</p>
