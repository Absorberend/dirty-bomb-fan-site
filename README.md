# Dirty Bomb Fan Page
This page is about the game Dirty Bomb. It's a game designed by Splash Damage and is one of my favorite games.
I used to play this game all the time back in the day. This is a pure HTML/CSS project with just a few lines of JavaScript. 
It was also a final assignment for a CSS course (part of HBO Frontend developer at the LOI) I was attending. 
This project resulted in an A+!
