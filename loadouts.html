            <h1>Dirty Bomb loadouts</h1>
            <p>Loadout cards are in-game collectibles that change a merc's abilities, weapons and skins. Some loadout cards are more desirable then others and better loadout cards can be crafted by players. Higher-level loadout cards DO NOT increase a players weapon stats, but will grant augments which help boost merc's abilities. After the bronze tier of loadout cards, they are purely cosmetic and only 3 augments can be on a loadout card at a time. Players do not have the ability to pick and choose weapons or augments.</p>
            <h2>Favorite loadouts</h2>
            <p>You can find my favorite loadouts below. You can also see a table with my top 2 favorite loadouts for each sniper class. I will explain when and why I use them.</p>

                <h3>F51 first edition</h3>
                <p>The reason I like this loadout so much is because it has a reduction in reload time. Which is amazing since the Felix is the slowest sniper rifle in the game to reload. When sniping you have to be able to finish off your enemies as quickly as possible before they get revived. That's why I like the quick draw perk on this loadout as well. You can switch faster from the Felix to your DE .50 to gib enemies. Lastly it also has the looter perk. You might think why would you ever need this? But it's actually very handy. Whenever you kill medics or fire support classes you get respectively a small health pack or ammo. This is great when you're lurking behind enemy lines so you don't have to kill out.</p>
                <h3>F51 second edition</h3>
                <p>I'm not entirely sure why but this card seems to be exactly the same as the first edition variant.  I don't know the reason why Splash Damage would create an exact copy of their previous version. Nonetheless this is in my opinion by far the best card for Aimee. Aimee doesn't have a MoA so it's either a Felix or a medium-range sniper. The choice is simple in my opinion. You can't spawn camp with a medium-range sniper or deal a huge amount of damage quickly (unless you have absolutely insane gun control).</p>

            <div class="vassili_loadout_wrapper">
                <h2 id="vassili_bladwijzer">Vassili</h2>
                <h3>F91 second edition</h3>
                <p>This loadout has the quick eye perk which makes your movement speed faster when you're scoped and it also increases the time it takes for you to scope in and out. Since Felix is the slowest sniper rifle and you're competing with other snipers you have to be able to be quick on your feet. This is the main perk why this loadout is the best for Vassili if you like the Felix. The extra ammo and enigma perk are just a bonus.</p>
                <h3>M093 first edition</h3>
                <p>Most high level Dirty bomb players would argue that this loadout is by far the best for Vassili. But since I prefer the Felix over the MoA I would disagree. This card also has the cricket bat instead of a knife. This makes you even slower than you already are. The revolver is a fantastic secondary. You can 2 or maybe 3 shot enemies from long range with the revolver alone (same applies to the F91 loadout). You can bodyshot most mercs with your MoA and shoot them one time in the body with the revolver and kill them off. All the perks on this card are based on survivability. It has health regen, you take less damage from projectiles (which you'll be hurt by the most as a sniper) and you will be flinched less when scoped in. But since Vassili (especially with the cricket bat) is so slow he is not a good lurker. So personally I don't really why you would need all this survivability when you could just kill out instead whenever you need to.</p>

                <h2 id="redeye_bladwijzer">Redeye</h2>
                <h3>G52 second edition</h3>
                <p>If you can handle the Grandeur this is pretty much the best loadout in the entire game. Redeye gets countered by enemy air supports, especially when Redeye stands in his smoke. But with the guardian angel perk you get notified whenever air support is about to hit you so you can get out in time. This loadout also has the quick eye perk which is probably the best perk for snipers (35% increased movement speed and raise/lower times when scoping).  Combined with the focus perk you can actually fight on the front lines as a sniper if you have a good medic behind you. You can scope in and move around quickly whilst not getting flinched as bad when you're scoped in. </p>
                <h3>P71 second edition</h3>
                <p>I've put this loadout in here because I think there should be an alternative to the Grandeur. The Grandeur is a terrible gun to handle in my opinion. So whenever I play Redeye I usually take this loadout with the PDP sniper instead since it's more precise.  It has quick draw and you still get notified whenever an enemy air support is about to hit nearby. The bomb squad perk is also key. Whenever you're in your smoke you'll notice that enemy snipers will throw their snitch etc. to detect and counter you. With the bomb squad perk you can easily spot their snitch and destroy it. Whenever you do you'll be invisible again to the enemy team and it makes the battle with the enemy sniper easier.</p>
